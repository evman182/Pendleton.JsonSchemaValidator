# Pendleton.SchemaValidator
This horrible thing is a .Net Standard 2.0 wrapper around [my fork](https://github.com/evman182/json-schema-validator) of a much better project: https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator  
  
Any issues with the dotnet wrapper you should bring to me. Any issues with Json Schema Validation, I won't be able to help you with.
  
I'll write an actual readme and setup CI badges and stuff when I have some time.
